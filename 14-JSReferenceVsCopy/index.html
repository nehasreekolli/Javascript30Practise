    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    console.log(age,age2); // 200, 100

    console.log(fname,lname); // sree,neha
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players,team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //  team[3] = "lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team3 = players.slice(); // gives actual array i.e, making copy
    // In console see team3[3] = "lux" then team3 only changes but not players

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [...players]; // spread each and every into new array
    team4[3] = "myself";
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players); // in console,team5[3] = "my" then team5 changes but not players
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
     const person ={
       name: 'nehasree',
       age: 23
     };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 3;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person,{number : 99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes ={
      name:'wes',
      age:'100',
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook : 'wesbos'
      }
    }
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign ({}, wes); // if we check dev.social.twitter = '@neha' then dev.social or wes.social it won't change to @neha because it goes only one level deep

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
